# strata-json

Strict RFC 8259 JSON parser for the Strata parser ecosystem.

## Status

This crate is in initial development. The public API is not settled yet.

## Usage

```rust
use strata_json::{JsonParser, Value};

let document = JsonParser::new().parse_str(r#"{ "name": "strata" }"#)?;

let Value::Object(object) = document.root() else {
    unreachable!()
};
let member = object.members.first().unwrap();

// Zero-copy access to the raw source bytes, quotes included, no decoding.
assert_eq!(document.token_bytes(&member.name), Some(&b"\"name\""[..]));
```

`JsonParser::new()` is fully strict RFC 8259. The builder exposes the spec-permitted options
(`allow_bom` per §8.1, `max_depth` per §9) and hooks to replace the token rules or lexer
configuration. See [`docs/strata-json.md`](docs/strata-json.md) for the full design reference.

MPL-2.0 is a file-level weak copyleft license: its obligations attach to this crate's files (in
source and compiled form) and to modifications of them, not to your own source files that merely
use this crate. Distributing a binary that includes this crate obliges you to tell recipients
that the crate is included and how to obtain its source; for an unmodified crate, pointing them
at the exact crates.io release is a reasonable way to do that. Example material (documentation
code examples, `examples/`, integration tests, and benchmarks) is additionally licensed under
[MIT-0](LICENSE-MIT-0), so it can be copied freely. See
